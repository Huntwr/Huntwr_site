# Huntwr Website

This is the source code for my personal website, built to showcase content from my YouTube channel.  
It includes my **pictures, videos**, and other creative projects (more sections may be added in the future).  

The site uses a **retro terminal-style interface** where visitors can type commands to explore different sections.
